											<h3>Team Activity: Discussion</h3>
										</header>
										<p><b>Q1: What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</b></br>
										A: No language is fully secure. Every language has different properties that make it more or less secure in different ways.</br></br>
										<b>Q2: Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</b></br>
										A:
										<li>Python has garbage collection which gives it protection against buffer overflow compared to languages without garbage collection like C.</li>
										<li>Python is a very widely used language with not many security incidents relating to the language itself.</li> </br>
										Despite this, as mentioned above, no language is fully secure, which includes Python.</br> </br>
										<b>Q3: Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</b></br>
										A:
										<li>Python would be better in a way because it’s more secure but it would be impractical to use for an operating system because it is an interpreted language that is executed slower than a compiled language like C.</li>
										<li>Python does not have access to low-level features such as hardware and memory addressing, instead relying on abstractions provided by an existing kernel. It is theoretically possible to create an operating system based mainly on Python but low-level features will have to be coded in a different language like C.</li>
										<li>In such a scenario, since we are not fully using Python we do not benefit entirely from its security features. Languages like C, C++, and Rust are more suitable for the task than Python. Rust’s security features give it a benefit in writing operating systems over C.</li>

											<h3>Activity - The Producer-Consumer Mechanism</h3>
										</header>
										<p> <b>Q1: How is the queue data structure used to achieve the purpose of the code?</b> </br>
										A: The queue data structure allows for a queue of items to be created which can then be taken from and removed using get(). </br></br>
										<b>Q2: What is the purpose of q.put(I)?</b></br>
										A: Queue.put() adds an item to the queue, in this case the producer adds the numbers from 0 to 100 to the queue via the for loop.</br></br>
										<b>Q3: What is achieved by q.get()?</b></br>
										A: Queue.get() removes an item from the queue and returns it, thus allowing the consumer to "take" said item.</br></br>
										<b>Q4: What functionality is provided by q.join()?</b></br>
										A: The consumer thread calls q.task_done(), which indicates to the queue that the item in question has been gotten. q.join() blocks execution, thus preventing the program from reaching the print() statement. Once all items have been gotten, join() unblocks execution and the print() statement executes.</br></br>
										<b>Q5: Extend this producer-consumer code to make the producer-consumer scenario available in a secure way. What technique(s) would be appropriate to apply?</b></br>
										A: The multiple consumer threads are allowed independent access to the queue. If two or more threads access it at the same time, they can both take the same item. To prevent this, a lock can be used as shown in the code <a href="https://github.com/htodorov0000/SecureSoftwareDevelopmentArtefacts/blob/main/Unit3/The%20Producer-Consumer%20Mechanism/ProducerConsumer.py">here</a>.

										<h2>Reflection</h2>
									</header>
										<p> This unit was the first unit during which the tasks presented required coding. This was more interesting to me because I enjoy practical tasks, but therefore it was also more complex.
										The Producer-Consumer mechanism task in particular was new to me, and it took me some time looking over the code and researching to understand it.
										Despite this, for the most part I managed to answer the provided questions. However, I did use a fellow student's advice to arrive at the answer for the final question. </br>
										This was also the first unit during which I met with the rest of the team to discuss the assignment. Although we are all busy, we have quickly agreed
										on ways in which we can mitigate this to work together and achieve the assignment, and I believe we are making good progress.</p>
