										<h2>Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today</h2>
										</header>
										<p> Cyclomatic Complexity is a method which allows developers to measure the amount of possible "paths" a piece of code (module, class, method, etc.) can take, with the purpose of determining
										complexity. It is self-explanatory that the more paths a function leads down, the more complex it is to read, change, or test. On the contrary however, Shepperd (1998) finds
										several issues with this method of thinking, namely that it is too abstract, difficult to prove, not observable equally in different contexts, and based on mostly intuition. </br>
										Despite the criticisms, I believe that Cyclomatic Complexity can serve to be useful in specific use-cases. An abnormally high Cyclomatic Complexity is likely to be a sign of 
										the code being unnecessarily convoluted. It should, however, not be relied on as the sole metric, as complexity is abstract and impossible to prove mathematically.</br>
										With regards to secure software development, testing is an important way to prevent security vulnerabilities. Minimizing the required tests is therefore key, and
										code which strives to rank lower on the Cyclomatic Complexity metric can help with this. </br> </br>

										<h2>Reflection</h2>
									</header>
										<p> This unit was my first experience with proper code testing. Despite learning a lot, I do not think I was able to give this my full
										attention during this week, as me and the team were also focused on the assignment. </br>
										Regarding the assignment, I find that my comparative lack of computer science knowledge is offset well by my teammates' willingness to help,
										and we have made good progress so far despite it.</p>
